        "I have read the Excel file through Pandas but not able to understand the question through the given problem. I have understood that i want to get transcript for URL file that is of XML nature and i ammtrying to get transcript bu using above code with request and if it passes then get content of it. Once i get content in an Excel Column named \"Transcript\" i can also extract audio for that. i think that audio/transcipt can descibe certain call decisions. As Converting from XML to tanscript was taking too much time i took first 10 rows by making a new df, then processing on that but i was getting 404 error. I tried fixing that but didnt gor through it. After that we can get important features and can get new df and save a new excel based on final requirements."
